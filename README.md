RandomForestClassifier from sklearn was used to indentify the bacteria type based on their contributions of each ATGC composition. You can find more information on my notebook [https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook)
