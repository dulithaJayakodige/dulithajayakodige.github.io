## Projects
### 1. Predicting Bacteria Types 

![alt text](bacteriatypeprediction2.png)

RandomForestClassifier from sklearn was used to identify the bacteria type based on their contributions to each ATGC composition. While working on this project I learned to use pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, confusion_matrix, and accuracy_score from sklearn. My model could predict the type of bacteria with up to 99% accuracy. You can find more information on my notebook [https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook)

### 2. IBM Data Science Capstone Project

I followed IBM Data Science Professional Certificate through coursera. As its capstone project, I predicted the success of a future SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets landing process. I used SpaceX API and Web Scraping to collet data for this project. Then I   proformed a explotary data analicis using pandas library and SQL . Then I visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn. Folium was used to makea  interactive  maps and Plotly Dash was used to built interactive visuals. I used Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Machine to predict the success of a future landing process. StandardScaler(), train_test_split(), and  GridSearchCV() functions from sklearn were also used for hyperparameter optimization and accuracy calculation.

### 3. HUBC TERMINAL hackathon

HUBC TERMINAL was an AI game where we could compete by programming algorithms and battling them against each other. I paired up with my friend, Chukwuemeka Ojih to participate in this competition. We used a given python template to build our algorithm to fight against opponents. Our algorithm was capable of figuring out the opponent's attacking and defending strategies and acting accordingly. At the final competition, our algorithm received 10th place (from 21 submitted algorithms). We practiced not only python programming, but also a virtual team working, and working to a deadline. It was really fun!
