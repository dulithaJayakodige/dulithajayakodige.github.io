## Projects

### 1. Predicting Bacteria Types 

![alt text](bacteriatypeprediction.png)

RandomForestClassifier from sklearn was used to indentify the bacteria type based on their contributions of each ATGC composition. While working on this project I learned to use pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, confusion_matrix, and accuracy_score from sklearn. My model could predit the type of a bacteria upto 99% accuracy. You can find more information on my notebook [https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook)
