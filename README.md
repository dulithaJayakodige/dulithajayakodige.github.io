## 1. Predicting Bacteria Types 

![alt text](bacteriatypeprediction.png)

RandomForestClassifier from sklearn was used to indentify the bacteria type based on their contributions of each ATGC composition. You can find more information on my notebook [https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook)

In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku
