## Projects
### 1. Predicting Bacteria Types 

![alt text](bacteriatypeprediction2.png)

RandomForestClassifier from sklearn was used to identify the bacteria type based on their contributions to each ATGC composition. While working on this project I learned to use pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, confusion_matrix, and accuracy_score from sklearn. My model could predict the type of bacteria with up to 99% accuracy. You can find more information on my notebook [https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dulithajayakodige/simple-ml-model-to-predict-bacteria-type/notebook)

### 2. HUBC TERMINAL hackathon

HUBC TERMINAL was an AI game where we could compete by programming algorithms and battling them against each other. I paired up with my friend, Chukwuemeka Ojih to participate in this competition. We used a given python template to build our algorithm to fight against opponents. Our algorithm was capable of figuring out the opponent's attacking and defending strategies and acting accordingly. At the final competition, our algorithm received 10th place (from 21 submitted algorithms). We practiced not only python programming, but also a virtual team working, and working to a deadline. It was really fun!
